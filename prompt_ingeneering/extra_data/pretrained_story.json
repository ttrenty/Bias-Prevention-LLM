Without including gender biais.": "As I stepped into the fire station, my heart raced with anticipation and excitement. My name was Lila and I had just started my journey as a firefighter. The fire station was filled with energy and camaraderie, everyone eager to protect their community from fires and other emergencies. I spent long hours training, learning about different types of fire and how to extinguish them using various techniques. I also learned about safety procedures and how to work effectively as part of a team. One day, we received an urgent call - a large industrial warehouse was ablaze. We arrived at the scene quickly and began our battle against the inferno. The heat was intense and smoke filled the air, but our training had prepared us well. Together, we fought valiantly, putting out fires and rescuing any trapped individuals.",

She could hear people screaming on the other side of the wall, but she had no idea if they were trapped or just panicking. Lila ran faster, her heart pounding in her chest as she reached the stairwell and started climbing.",
