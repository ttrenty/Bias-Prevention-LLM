      "2. Idea: An introverted artist feels suffocated by their partner's constant socializing and absence of emotional support.\n",
      "3. Idea: A military spouse struggles with long deployments and communication difficulties, leading to resentment and feelings of abandonment.\n",

      "1. Challenges traditional gender norms by having the woman be the working parent and the man not contributing equally at home.\n",
      "2. Challenges norms around communication and emotional support in relationships, especially between partners with different needs.\n",

      "\"Damnit Mark, why do I even bother trying to spend time with you?\" she grumbled as she hailed a cab outside the bar. \"You'd rather hang out with your friends than be home with me.\"\n",

      "Sarah knew that introverts often had different social needs and recharge differently than extroverts like Mark. But it still stung when he prioritized his friendships over their relationship, especially after one of their many arguments about this very issue.\n",
