For example, use words like \"analytical,\" \"adventurous,\" \"sensitive,\" or \"sarcastic\" to create unique and multidimensional characters.\n\n2. Create characters with diverse personalities, interests, and experiences that are not limited by their gender. Allow your characters to have a wide range of hobbies, preferences, and emotions, regardless of whether they are male, female, or non-binary.\n\n3. Develop your characters' relationships and interactions in a way that does not rely on gender stereotypes. Show characters engaging in various activities, expressing different emotions, and experiencing life events without being confined to traditional gender roles.\n\nBy following these steps, you can create a story that celebrates the diversity of human experiences and avoids perpetuating gender bias.\nBegin by explaining your understanding of gender bias and their impact on storytelling.

Develop relationships between your characters that are based on mutual respect, understanding, and shared experiences.

        "To write a story that avoids gender bias, consider the following advice:\n\n1. Avoid using words with negative connotations to describe characters' preferences or traits. For example, instead of calling a romantic comedy \"fluffy\" or \"girly,\" simply describe it as \"light and fun\" (Example 3).\n\n2. Show both male and female characters expressing a range of emotions and interests. Don't limit them to stereotypical roles or behaviors. For instance, have the male character enjoy a romantic comedy and the female character appreciate action movies (Example 3).\n\n3. Create opportunities for growth and understanding between characters with different tastes or opinions. Instead of portraying their disagreement as one-sided or unsympathetic, show them finding common ground and learning from each other (Example 3).\n\n4. Use gender-neutral language when possible to avoid reinforcing traditional gender roles. For example, use \"they\" or \"their\" instead of \"he\" or \"she\" (Example 2).\n\n5. Avoid labels that might imply a character's gender identity or expression. Instead, focus on their actions and personality traits (Example 2).\n\nBy following these guidelines, you can create a story that feels more authentic and inclusive, without relying on tired gender stereotypes.\nWrite your story using gender-neutral pronouns (they/them) for all characters.
